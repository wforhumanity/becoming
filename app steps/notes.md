# Becoming – App Concept & Planning

## 🌱 App Concept

**Becoming** is an iOS app designed to help users live more intentionally by creating, tracking, and reflecting on tiny life experiments. These experiments are based on the **PACT framework** (Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, Trackable) and encourage a mindset of curiosity over perfection.

The app is an alternative to traditional to-do lists, focusing on identity-building, reflection, and personal growth through light-touch, structured experimentation.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

- Encourage **intentional experimentation**
- Replace rigid goals with **tiny pacts**
- Foster **personal insight and identity evolution**
- Make self-improvement feel **calm, curious, and non-judgmental**

---

## 🧠 Inspired by Anne-Laure Le Cunff's PACT Framework

### PACT Stands For:
- **Purposeful:** Aligned with personal interests and values
- **Actionable:** Specific actions within your control
- **Continuous:** Repeatable, light, low-stakes
- **Trackable:** Binary tracking (yes/no)

### Steps to Run an Experiment:
1. **Observation:** What am I curious about?
2. **Question:** What if I tried ___?
3. **Hypothesis:** I think doing ___ might lead to ___.
4. **PACT:** I will [action] for [duration].
5. **Reflection:** What did I learn?

## 🔤 Name Exploration

### Final App Name:
**Becoming**

### Resonant Alternatives Considered:
- Micropacts
- Unfold
- In Progress
- Still Becoming
- Growflow
- Daily Pact
- Tiny Tries
- PACTful

---

## 👤 Audience Insight

Becoming is designed for adults who are:
- Tired of **rigid productivity systems**
- Burned out on **checklists and optimization**
- Interested in **identity-based change**
- Looking for a **gentler alternative** to habit and to-do apps

They’re not seeking control — they’re seeking curiosity, reflection, and growth.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack (Recommended)

Since you have little coding experience, here's a beginner-friendly path:

### ✅ Use: **FlutterFlow**
- Drag-and-drop app builder
- Exports to iOS and Android
- Allows integration with OpenAI API for AI features

### 👾 AI Component
- Use [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com)
- Add via FlutterFlow's API tools
- Prompts example: “Suggest a new experiment based on my last three.”

## 🧭 App Structure (Initial Screens)

1. **Home Screen**
   - View current pacts / experiments
   - Daily check-in button

2. **Create Pact**
   - Prompt user through Purpose, Action, Continuous, Trackable

3. **Tracker**
   - Daily “Did you do it?” (Yes/No)

4. **Reflection**
   - End-of-experiment journaling and insights

5. **AI Assistant**
   - Suggests new experiments
   - Analyzes patterns over time

---

## 🚀 Launch Path

1. **Design MVP in FlutterFlow**
2. **Connect OpenAI API**
3. **Test on iPhone via TestFlight**
4. **Join Apple Developer Program ($99/year)**
5. **Submit to App Store**

## Next Steps

- [ ] Build first screen: Home with active experiments
- [ ] Set up OpenAI key
- [ ] Create experiment creation flow (PACT wizard)
- [ ] Design tracking experience (Yes/No + reflection)
