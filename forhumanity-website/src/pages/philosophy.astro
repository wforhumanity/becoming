          <h2>The PACT Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            At the core of our work is the PACT framework—a mindset that values small, 
            intentional experiments over rigid goals and productivity systems. We believe 
            that meaningful change happens through consistent, purposeful actions aligned 
            with our values.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The PACT framework encourages us to create experiments that are:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purposeful:</strong> Connected to our deeper values and interests</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Specific and within our control</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Repeatable, light, and low-stakes</li>
            <li><strong>Trackable:</strong> Simple to monitor with binary (yes/no) tracking</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            This approach allows us to focus on the process of becoming rather than 
            achieving specific outcomes. It's about identity-based change, not just 
            checking items off a list.
          </p>

          <h2>Experimental Living > Productivity</h2>
          <p>
            We reject the notion that human value comes from productivity or optimization. 
            Instead, we embrace a mindset of curiosity, experimentation, and reflection. 
            We believe that a life well-lived is one of continuous learning and growth, 
            not just efficient task completion.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Our tools are designed to encourage:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Curiosity over certainty</li>
            <li>Reflection over rushing</li>
            <li>Growth over achievement</li>
            <li>Process over outcomes</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            We're building alternatives to the productivity industrial complex—tools that 
            help people live more intentionally, reflectively, and aligned with their values.

          <h2>AI as a Mirror, Not a Master</h2>
          <p>
            We believe in using artificial intelligence as a tool for reflection and 
            insight, not as a replacement for human judgment or agency. Our approach 
            to AI is:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reflective:</strong> AI should help us see ourselves more clearly</li>
            <li><strong>Suggestive:</strong> AI should offer options, not directives</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> AI systems should be understandable and explainable</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> AI should respect privacy and human autonomy</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            We're building AI tools that act as gentle companions in our journey of 
            self-discovery and growth, not as authorities or decision-makers.

        <div class="philosophy-section">
          <h2>Tech as Care and Art</h2>
          <p>
            We see technology development as both an act of care and a form of art. 
            Our approach to building technology is:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Human-centered:</strong> Designed for real human needs and experiences</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> Respecting privacy, agency, and wellbeing</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable:</strong> Built to last and minimize environmental impact</li>
            <li><strong>Beautiful:</strong> Crafted with attention to aesthetics and experience</li>
            <li><strong>Open:</strong> Transparent, accessible, and community-driven</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            We believe that technology should be a force for healing and growth, not 
            extraction and addiction. We're building tools that embody these values 
            and contribute to a more humane technological future.
          </p>

        <div class="philosophy-section">
          <h2>Decentralized Futures, Innersource</h2>
          <p>
            We believe in the power of decentralized, community-driven development. 
            Our approach is:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open-source:</strong> Our code is freely available for review and contribution</li>
            <li><strong>Donation-supported:</strong> We rely on community support, not venture capital</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> We welcome contributions from anyone who shares our values</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Our processes and decisions are open for discussion</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            We're building a model of technology development that prioritizes community 
            ownership, ethical sustainability, and shared governance. We believe that 
            the future of technology should be in the hands of the many, not the few.
