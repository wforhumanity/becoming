          <h2>What is Becoming?</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming is an iOS app designed to help users live more intentionally by creating, 
            tracking, and reflecting on tiny life experiments. It's an alternative to traditional 
            to-do lists, focusing on identity-building, reflection, and personal growth through 
            light-touch, structured experimentation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The app guides users through creating "pacts" based on the PACT framework:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purposeful:</strong> Aligned with personal interests and values</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Specific actions within your control</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Repeatable, light, low-stakes</li>
            <li><strong>Trackable:</strong> Binary tracking (yes/no)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Users can track their progress daily with simple yes/no tracking, and reflect on 
            their experiences at the end of each experiment. The app also provides AI-generated 
            suggestions for new experiments based on past experiences.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project-inspiration">
          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming is inspired by Anne-Laure Le Cunff's work on experimental mindsets and 
            the PACT framework. It's designed for adults who are tired of rigid productivity 
            systems, burned out on checklists and optimization, and looking for a gentler 
            alternative to habit and to-do apps.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The app encourages a mindset of curiosity over perfection, focusing on the process 
            of becoming rather than achieving specific goals. It's about identity-based change, 
            reflection, and growth.
          </p>

        <div class="project-tech">
          <h2>Technical Details</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming is built with:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flutter:</strong> For cross-platform development (iOS, Android)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For authentication and data storage</li>
            <li><strong>Riverpod:</strong> For state management</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> For AI-generated experiment suggestions</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The app follows a clean architecture approach with a focus on testability, 
            maintainability, and scalability. It uses an API-first, testing-second, 
            code-third approach to development.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Status</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming is currently in MVP development. The core features are being implemented, 
            including:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Creating and managing pacts</li>
            <li>Daily tracking</li>
            <li>End-of-experiment reflection</li>
            <li>AI-generated suggestions</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The app will be available on iOS first, with Android support planned for the future.

        <div class="project-ethics">
          <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming is designed with ethical considerations at its core:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy-focused:</strong> User data is stored securely and not shared with third parties</li>
            <li><strong>AI as a gentle companion:</strong> AI suggestions are presented as options, not directives</li>
            <li><strong>Non-addictive design:</strong> No engagement-maximizing dark patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Open-source:</strong> Code is available for review and contribution</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project-links text-center py-8">
          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from developers, 
            designers, writers, and anyone interested in building more humane technology.
